# Introduction

This is my repository for my dotfiles backup.
For the moment, I am still developping my config files. This branch in particular corresponds to my PC setup. I am currently using Xmonad and Xmobar as a WM.


# Future changes

I wish to use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as a symlink managing software to sync all my dotfiles across all my devices
