# Introduction

This is my repository for my dotfiles backup. I am currently still developping my configuration files.
This branch in particular of `.dotfiles`  is for my Laptop configuration.


# Future changes

I wish to use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as a symlink managing software to sync all my dotfiles across all my devices
